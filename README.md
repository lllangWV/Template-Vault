# Template vault setup

This file is to help setting up the vault at the initialization and to explain the schema of the vaults. 

***
## Schema

This is the schema of the vaults. It defines all the folders and what they are used for. It takes inspiration from the zettlekasten and para organization system.

### 00 - Excalidraw

This directory is used for creating drawing in excalidraw. This could probably be replaced with somei

### 01 - Projects

This is the projects folders. This should be for projects that have a start and and end date. For example creating a video. Once the project is finished it should be stored in archives. This comes from the zettlekasten / para system

## 02 - Areas

This is similar to the projects directory but it is for areas of study that are more permanent. For example "Programming in Python", "Cooking", "Brewing Beer", etc. This comes from the para system of organization

### 03 - Resources

The resources acts as a place to store external information to your notes. It should contain literature notes, pdf, images, videos. In the folder I have a place to store my literature notes and external images I use in other notes. This is similar to the concept of literature/ reference notes in the zettlekasten system. The name comes from the para system which it essentially serves the same role.

### 04 - Permanent

This is for permanent notes. These should contain notes that are intended permanent notes on concept you have researched. Usually the are an combination of question notes and literature notes. This idea come from the zettlekasten system.

### 05 - Fleeting

This is for fleeting notes. This are more temporary notes. This is for storing notes on ideas you have when you are inspired by something you reading and you want to maybe come back to the idea later. Here I have an Idea directory for random ideas, Inbox directory for random thoughts I have, and Questions directory to store question I come up with when reading. This idea comes from the zettlekasten system

### 06 - Daily

This is for daily notes. This is for journaling and keeping track of task you have on a daily basis. You can easily create a daily note by clicking `Open today's daily note` on the far left ribbon.

### 07 - Archives

This is the archive directory. This is intended for storage on items that you will not access frequently or finished projects

### 99 - Meta

This directory serves as a place to store meta data for the vault. For example I store Note templates here.

***
## Setting up the vault

This section has steps to setup the vaults. I.e configuring community plugins. Directories to specify where files should go, and templates

### Community Plugins

The first thing you should do is turn on community plugins. This can be found in the setting. you can access the setting by clicking on the cog in the lower left corner. Then pressing `Community Plugins` , then pressing `Turn on commuity plugins`. There should already be plugging installed. If you do not see them close the obsidian and reopen it. This loads all the plugins on the start. You should immediately notice a differences. Once this loads mostly everything should be set up.

### Zotero integration

For zotero integration I suggest following this [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9ivU_IKO6M&t=457s)

### Templates


If you want to have it so when you create a new note in a specific format. You should use the templater community plugin. In the templater settings, which is found by clicking on settings and scrolling through the pluggins in the lower left corner of the settings window. Here, you can see some settings. The first option should tell where your template directory is. It should already be pointing to `99 - Meta/Templates`

#### Directory templates

If you scroll down the the folder template section. You can set what template to use whenever you open a note in that directory. For example, you should see I have a template set up for the `05 - Fleeting/Questions` Directory.

#### Daily Note template

You can also set a template for your daily notes. This can be donw by going to `Daily notes` settings. It should already be configured though.

Inspiration for the vault template comes from these videos

This is where the schema came from. This is why you see the directory headers. The prepended number are important for this. The css snippits detects them.
